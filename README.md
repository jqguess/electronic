# Electronic Supply
===================
(http://jqguess.net/electronicsupply)


>This is a Repo for a site I built a while back that uses PHP and MySQL.  
I recently reworked the site to be responsive using bootstrap. The Sign Up 
and Login system are secure and active using respective classes for operation. I
added a comment section that  uses a PDO db connection along with current 
security measures.  I would suggest having your users login before posting,
because this solution is mainly for demonstration.


>I fully intend on using this site in the near future to create a web 
solution for a similar company that could use an upgrade.

>Until that point in time, I will likely keep improving this site so that
all I will need to do is plug in real data for the inventory he sells and 
reconfigure the database as needed.
