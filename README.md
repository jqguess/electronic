# Electronic Supply
===================
(http://jqguess.net/electronicsupply)


>This is a Repo for a site I built a while back for class.  
I recently reworked the site to be mobile first using bootstrap. The Sign Up 
and Login system are active using MySQL and some security measures such as
password encryption, which are revised versions of php-login-minimal that 
can still be found on GitHub.

>I fully intend on using this site in the near future to create a web 
solution for my Grandfather who owns the company Electronic Supply.
His website needs an upgrade badly, and it will be great to finally do 
something for him instead of vice versa.

>Until that point in time, I will likely keep improving this site so that
all I will need to do is populate the inventory he sells and reconfigure
the database. In the rare chance someone finds and could use this for 
some reason, feel free too.
