# Electronic Supply

Repo for a site I built a while back for class.  
I recently reworked the site to be mobile first using bootstrap. The secure login system
is active, and is a revised version of PHP simple login found on GitHub.
I still need to redo the shopping cart though and add a comment
section. Anyone wanting to use this to build on is welcome too.
