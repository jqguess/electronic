# Electronic Supply
===================
(http://jqguess.net/electronicsupply)


>This is a Repo for a site I built a while back that uses PHP and MySQL.  
I recently reworked the site to be responsive using bootstrap. The Sign Up 
and Login system are active using MySQL, although I would recommend using
a PDO connection in the off chance someone forks this.

>I fully intend on using this site in the near future to create a web 
solution for my Grandfather who owns the company Electronic Supply.
His website needs an upgrade badly, and it will be great to finally do 
something for him instead of vice versa.

>Until that point in time, I will likely keep improving this site so that
all I will need to do is populate the inventory he sells and reconfigure
the database.
